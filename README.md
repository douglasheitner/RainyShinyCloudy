This app gets the user's current location via Core Location. It displays the current weather and the next 10 days of forecast weather.

It downloads the weather information from [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) using Alamofire via Cocoapods.

The UI/UX is as simple as possible. Offering the information without bugging the user for unnecessary interaction.
